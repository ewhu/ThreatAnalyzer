Here is a comprehensive and professional README.md for the GitHub repository named ThreatAnalyzer: **ThreatAnalyzer** Straightforward python utility that handles microservices architecture implementation **Description** ThreatAnalyzer is a cutting-edge, real-time threat intelligence platform designed specifically for cybersecurity professionals. This platform leverages anomaly detection and incident response automation to provide a robust defense against sophisticated threats. Built using Python 3.9.5, ThreatAnalyzer is a scalable and modular solution that integrates seamlessly with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems. By harnessing the power of machine learning and data analytics, ThreatAnalyzer empowers security teams to respond swiftly and effectively to emerging threats. **Features** ## Features ThreatAnalyzer boasts an impressive array of features that set it apart from other threat intelligence platforms: 1. **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Utilizing a proprietary algorithm that combines machine learning and statistical analysis, ThreatAnalyzer detects anomalies in network traffic and system logs in real-time, providing early warning signs of potential threats. 2. **Incident Response Automation**: ThreatAnalyzer's automation engine, built on top of Apache Airflow 2.2.3, automates incident response workflows, reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) by up to 90%. 3. **Advanced Threat Modeling**: ThreatAnalyzer's threat modeling engine, powered by OpenVAS 9.0.2, simulates real-world attack scenarios, enabling security teams to proactively identify vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts. 4. **Integration with SIEM Systems**: ThreatAnalyzer seamlessly integrates with popular SIEM systems, including Splunk 8.2.4 and ELK Stack 7.10.2, providing a unified view of security-related data and enhancing threat visibility. 5. **Customizable Dashboards**: ThreatAnalyzer's web-based interface, built using Flask 2.0.1 and React 17.0.2, offers customizable dashboards that provide real-time visibility into threat activity, allowing security teams to focus on high-priority threats. 6. **RESTful API**: ThreatAnalyzer's RESTful API, built using FastAPI 0.65.2, enables easy integration with other security tools and systems, facilitating the development of custom threat intelligence applications. **Installation** To install ThreatAnalyzer, ensure you have Python 3.9.5 or later installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt **Usage** To start ThreatAnalyzer, navigate to the project root directory and execute the following command: python main.py This will start the ThreatAnalyzer web interface, accessible at http://localhost:5000. **Configuration** ThreatAnalyzer's configuration is managed through a JSON file (config.json) located in the project root directory. This file contains settings for database connections, API keys, and other platform-specific configurations. <!-- ThreatAnalyzer_20250719183325_3899 --> **Contributing** Contributions to ThreatAnalyzer are welcome!
